                            Hi there!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the end of the semester approaches, I’m reminded of all the great things that have happened this semester. First, I created some pretty cool videos in my film class. One is a fake horror movie trailer, and the other is a documentary about my hometown. I created a great foundation of a course registration system for colleges/universities with two others. We’re going to continue building this into the break and next semester. I was also converted from someone who hated social media to someone who posts regularly on Twitter about web development and the like. Thanks Dr. Zuegner! 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Jokes aside, I learned a lot about myself this semester with an array of fun classes and projects. Applying for jobs made me humble as I compete against top tier talent for different positions. Unfortunately, I’m in the middle of an intersection as I am interested in so many different ideas, unsure what to pursue. I want to (and think I can) become the top 5% of people in my field, the problem is I just must commit to one field and go. I’m torn between web design, software engineering, and film. I also have other goals, like happiness, making money, and growing my Twitter account. I’m working at a bar back home over the break, which fills the happiness and money requirements, but it also means I will be spending less time becoming the top 5% in my field. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have big goals, but I’m comforted with the idea that I’m pretty sure no one around me knows what they’re doing either, and that I’ve got time to figure stuff out. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I guess I should talk about my social media class now, because that’s the reason I’m even writing in the first place. As I mentioned, I committed to posting some ideas on Twitter, and I’m satisfied with my success so far. I started from 0, and only a few people I actually know follow me. I knew a little bit about social media before this class (I grew an Instagram theme page from 0 to 28k followers a few years ago). But I still learned the value that social media can provide companies and personal brands. This was the tipping point for me to start providing value to the world. My brother has a large following on Twitter, so both this class and him were enough convincing. I think that this is the most important accomplishment this semester in relation to this class. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thanks for everything Dr. Zuegner, both inside and outside of class. I’ll see you next semester!
