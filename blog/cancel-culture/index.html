                            The unfortunate reality is that people on social media are thrown under the bus for seemingly insignificant or simply untrue narratives based on false assumptions and quick reactions. I don't agree with this at all and believe that oftentimes people are too sensitive on social media. Of course, these tools are a way to people to discuss and express ideas, but to dig up old messages that have no relevance to a person's character today to ruin their life is ridiculous. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I think that many times when a person is 'canceled' it is out of a negative intent. Some might argue that the cancelling is an attempt to help the person learn from their mistakes, but I think this is oftentimes not the case. The cancelling instead is an attack at the person, with the goal of ruining their reputation and career. In one case, Justine Sacco was just making a joke that plays on the idea of white privilege. In another case, Aaron Calvin was the victim of a twisted story that wasn't really true. Both cases were created out of quick judgement, false assumptions, and the story-hungry media. And both cases resulted in the victim losing their job along with their sanity. Sacco explained how she would sit at home for months because she was unsure what to do. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's hard to support such cancelling when the share button is so easily accessible on these platforms. Why wouldn't it be? It's content like this that gets peoples' attention. Because of this, it's easy to see how a twisted story can get spread so quickly â€“ with the real names of real people on them. It's not fair, and has absolutely no positive outcome for anyone but media outlets and social media companies. If there was a benefit to cancel culture, I might buy cancelling. With no benefit, I can't support the unfair spotlight on harmless people.
