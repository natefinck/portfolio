                            In my middle and high school years, I must admit I was a fanatic. 
                            Snapchat streaks, Instagram likes and Twitter retweets; they pretty 
                            much shaped everything I did. To the point where I almost skipped 
                            a school trip because we had to turn in our phones (I didn’t want 
                            to lose my 700-day Snapchat streak). Luckily, this was pretty much 
                            the first time I said enough is enough. I gave up social media for 
                            lent my junior year of high school, and I’ve been mindful of my 
                            screen time ever since. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And I’ve come a long way! My screen time is still more than I’d 
                            like, but it gets pretty difficult when so many of our everyday needs 
                            come through our phone. I average about 2-3 hours on my cell phone 
                            per day, and it seems I am doing pretty good compared to the results 
                            of 
                            <a href="http://projects.thepostathens.com/SpecialProjects/behind-the-screens-time-spent-on-phone/index.html#:~:text=Students%20who%20took%20the%20survey,adults%20spend%20on%20their%20phones">
                                this survey
                            </a> 
                            on college students at Ohio University. I like both Instagram and 
                            Facebook because they allow me to keep up with the people I don’t see 
                            often. Unfortunately, it seems they’re both filled with suggested 
                            posts and ads that grab my attention, but don’t necessarily interest 
                            me. Regardless, they fill my time. In fact, time is the main reason I 
                            don’t have Twitter or TikTok. When I had them before, obviously, I 
                            enjoyed them a lot. Too much, however; I ended up deleting them both a 
                            few weeks after downloading. 
                        </p>

                            I don’t like how social media has become a social status game. Sure, 
                            I post on Instagram, but my posts are pretty dumb (Seriously, my last 
                            few 
                            <a href="https://www.natefinck.com/instagram">posts</a> 
                            made no sense to an outsider). I use the app for fun – posting 
                            photos that are fun to post. Instagram has become a platform to show 
                            off your best self, and I think it’s especially fake. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That isn’t even the worst of social media. Many issues – surveillance, 
                            threat to democracy, and censorship among others – plague social media. 
                            I believe the most important issue, though, is the 
                            <a href="https://childmind.org/article/how-using-social-media-affects-teenagers/">
                                link between social media addiction and depression 
                            </a>. 
                            It’s truly a shame that so many people, especially youth, are drug 
                            into social media unknowingly and suffer the harsh effects that it has.

                            Social media can be powerful, and as a student of media I understand its 
                            potential. That’s why I made this website, as a 
                            way to get myself and my work out there to those who may be interested. I 
                            know that as long as I’m being genuine and professional online, I’ll stay 
                            out of trouble.
